# 👋🏾 Welcome to my GitHub!

Hello there! I'm Eluse, and you've just stepped into my digital workshop. Here’s where I build, experiment, and share projects that merge the worlds of **software** and **hardware**. From tackling real-world problems to exploring curious (and occasionally random) ideas, this is my humble space for creation and growth.

## 💡 What happens here?
This GitHub is my collection of passion projects, learning experiments, and tools that solve real-world problems (or just make life easier). Some highlights:

### 🎧 [Spotipy](https://github.com/Esiwehl/spotipy)
A CLI tool to get personalized song recommendations by mixing your favorite tracks. Built with Python 3.12 and the Spotify API.

### 🚪 [Computer Vision: Door Detection in Robotics](https://github.com/Esiwehl/ComputerVision_DoorDetection)
A machine learning project focused on detecting doors in physical environments using computer vision techniques.

## 🎨 Fun fact
The brain is like a pattern-recognition machine! When we're learning something new, it doesn’t store information as isolated facts—it tries to link it to things you already know. That’s why analogies, stories, and hands-on experiences make concepts stick better. So, the next time we're tackling a tough problem, lets think of it as building a mental web and the more connections, the stronger it gets. 🧠✨
